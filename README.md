## Stack

Implements a stack, a basic data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. It allows you to efficiently store and manipulate a collection of elements, making it ideal for various applications.

## Sudoku solver

Solves Sudoku puzzles using the backtracking algorithm. It systematically fills in the puzzle's missing numbers, testing each possibility until a valid solution is found. The program offers a clear example of backtracking's power in efficiently solving complex puzzles.

## Bank simulation

 Simulates a typical day at a bank, modeling customer interactions and service operations. It employs two abstract data types: a queue for managing customer lineups and a big integer (big_int) for handling large numerical calculations. The program showcases the practical applications of these data structures in a real-world scenario, making it a valuable educational and illustrative tool.

 ## Graphs

 Implemented a flight route finder program that allows users to find the cheapest flight route between two cities and determine its price. The program assumes the possibility of cases where no such route exists, and it uses a graph representation based on the neighborhood matrix to achieve this.
